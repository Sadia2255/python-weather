# Python Flask Weather App

This is a weather app created using Python and Flask. You can type in a valid city name,
and the website will pull data from openweathermap.org and show the weather!

### Installing

To download the program, install all of the files in the repository and
make sure you have all the requirements, which are found in requirements.txt

### Executing program

To deploy as a web app, you can use a web service such as Render,
which is what I have done. A link to the web service is on my GitHub
as well!

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed as a final project in Dave Gray's Python course.
